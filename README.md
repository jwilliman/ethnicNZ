# ethnicNZ
Format ethnicity data collected via the New Zealand census questionnaire.

As stated on the Stats NZ website
> Ethnicity is a measure of cultural affiliation. It is not a measure of race,
ancestry, nationality, or citizenship. Ethnicity is self perceived and people
can belong to more than one ethnic group.


## Capturing ethnicity
In research, ethnicity is typically captured using the Standard Ethnicity
Questionnaire as used in the Census.

## Reporting ethnicity
The New Zealand Ministry of Health recommends that:
> Where thereare multiple ethnicities for a respondent, one of the following
three methods of output must be used: 
  a) total response (overlapping)
  b) prioritised (the most common form of output in the health and disability
sector) 
  c) sole/combination.

### Total response
When reporting ethnicity as total response, the StatsNZ Level 1 codes are typically used.

Code | Descriptor
---- | ----------
1 | European
2 | Māori
3 | Pacific Peoples
4 | Asian
5 | Middle Eastern/Latin American/African
6 | Other Ethnicity
9 | Residual Categories


### Prioritised

Priority order | Ethnic group code (Level 1) | Ethnic group code description
-------------- | --------------------------- | -----------------------------
1 | 2 | Māori
2 | 3 | Pacific Peoples
3 | 4 | Asian
